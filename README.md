# cro-redirect-code

Hi Danes!

In this repo, I've added the code from Crometrics' two redirects with WDI. In each variation folder, there are shared code and variation code js files that they used to enable the WDI redirect back in the fall. 


From my testing, variation two seems to be about a couple seconds faster than v1. However, both variations do not have fast enough load times to deploy to production.
